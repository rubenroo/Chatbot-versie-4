Toevoeging
Om de chatbot te laten werken in Binder heb ik de benodige code toegevoegd om NLTK te installeren.


# How it works
The Chatbot uses a DNN ((Deep Neural Network) to identify patterns in user input and generate a relevant response. The NLTK Library in Python is used to extract relevant words from sentences, reduce them to their root form (stemming), and convert them to numerical values (One-Hot Encoding) for use in the neural network. The neural network is created using Tensorflow's Tflearn library, and trained on a dataset of user queries and corresponding responses. Once trained, the model is able to predict a response to a user's query.

# What the chatbot can do
The chatbot demonstrates the techniques mentioned above. The following questions are possible:

- You can introduce yourself (Hi, my name is...)
- You can ask for the bot's name (What is your name?)
- Ask how he is doing (How are you?)
- You can say that you are fine (I am fine)
- End the converstation (Quit)





# Why this project
I have done the minor Real Fake, Real Impact. During the minor, I immersed myself in AI and Digital Humans. One of the topics was learning the basics of pyton. With the knowledge learned, I created 4 different chatbots. Each chatbot was built with different techniques and with  diffrent purposes.
