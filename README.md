# Chatbot-versie-4
As part of my school project, I asked ChatGPT to provide code for a chatbot in pyton. I specified that I wanted to make use of NLTK. In this repository, I describe the results.

# How it works
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a library in Python that provides tools to work with human language data (text) in a variety of ways, such as tokenizing, stemming, and tagging. It also includes a collection of text-based data sets and other resources for natural language processing tasks. The library is built on top of other Python libraries, such as the base Numpy and Scipy libraries, and it is designed to be easy to use and extend. It provides a wide range of functionality including text processing, linguistic data and resources, and wrappers for industrial-strength NLP libraries.

#The results
ChatGPT managed to successfully create a simple chatbot with NLTK using code in pyton. The code was working within seconds.

I did add the necessary code to install NLTK myself. Without this code, it would not work inside binder. Of course, I asked ChatGPT which code was necessary for this.

# What the chatbot can do
The chatbot demonstrates the techniques mentioned above. The following questions are possible:

- You can introduce yourself (Hi, my name is...)
- You can ask for the bot's name (What is your name ?)
- Ask how he is doing (How are you ?)
- You can say that you are fine (I am fine)
- End the converstation (Quit)



# Why this project
I have done the minor Real Fake, Real Impact. During the minor, I immersed myself in AI and Digital Humans. One of the topics was learning the basics of pyton. With the knowledge learned, I created 4 different chatbots. Each chatbot was built with different techniques and with  diffrent purposes.
